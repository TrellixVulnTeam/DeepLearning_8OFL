Taken from Udacity GAN material

the udacity GAN creates GAN from mnist. Does this increase generalization? 
Yes, the real value of GANS is to perform semisupervised learning where we 
use a smaller number of labeled training data to improve classification/classifier performance. 
The landmark results were from the streetview dataset where OpenAI got 6% error with 1k 
images vs the best result at 16% error.
