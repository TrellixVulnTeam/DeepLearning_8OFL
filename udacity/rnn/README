Vanilla RNN when unrolled becomes a CNN

seq2seq requires a vector input and a vector output. The vectors are input sequences and predicted output sequneces. These can't be unrolled into a CNN b/c they use more complicated cells with memory or forgetfullness

One issue is how BackPropagation through time is treated in the cases beyond vanilla RNNs. There are normalization strategies
including gradient clipping for overflow and xx for vanishiing gradients.
